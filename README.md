# Backend for BUS 101

This repository hosts the FastAPI backend for a web application, which was presented as the final project for the Core course in Business (BUS 101, R3T4). The application features a dialogue system that interprets user preferences expressed in natural language, and subsequently suggests a variety of potential gift items from an existing database.
